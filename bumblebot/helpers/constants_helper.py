Hi guys,

This code is opensource and available on GitHub.
repository: https://github.com/frederikme/TinderBotz

If you find the code useful, it would mean a lot if you can star the repository to show your appreciation.
If you're interested in learning how to write these bots yourself,
I will be making tutorials about python selenium automation soon.

youtube_channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1i3N9R9XYxt5Imi-auLPuA
tutorials that will be coming:
1. Scraping news on websites -> For absolute beginners, as an intro to selenium 
2. A simplified Tinderbot -> For beginners
3. Writing an automated chess bot to play on Chess.com using stockfish (currently a private repository). -> Advanced

Have a nice day,
Frederikme
